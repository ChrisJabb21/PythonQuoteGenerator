# PythonQuoteGenerator
A CLI based program that generates quotes using a random selection generator.
This is a program I made to keep track of quotes by a famous Lebanese poet, Kahlil Gibran. The purpose of this program was to have some quotes for the user to read for wisdom.

It is an idea i came up with for a Introduction to python class in Grad School
and wanted to add to my portfolio in case in the future I wanted to add 

# Some plans and considerations: 
    Find ways of implementing the quotes with a Python GUI using a window form
