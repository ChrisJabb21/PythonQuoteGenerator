# PythonQuoteGenerator
A CLI based program that generates quotes using a random selection generator.
This is a program I made to keep track of quotes by a famous Lebanese poet, Kahlil Gibran. The purpose of this program was to have some quotes for the user to read for wisdom.

It is an idea i came up with for a Introduction to python class in Grad School
and wanted to add to my portfolio in case in the future I wanted to add 
some improvements and considerations: 

find other ways of implementing the quotes such
as with a Python GUI.
