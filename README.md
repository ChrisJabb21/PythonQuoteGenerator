# PythonQuoteGenerator
A program that generates quotes using a random selection generator

This is a program I made to keep track of quotes by a famous Lebanese poet, Kahlil Gibran. The purpose of this program was to have some quotes for the user to read for wisdom.

It is an idea i came up with while in Grad School 
and wanted to add to my portfolio in case in the future i wanted to add 
some improvements or i find other ways of implementing the quotes such
as with a Python GUI.
